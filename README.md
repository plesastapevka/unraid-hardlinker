# Unraid utility scripts

This repository contains a collection of some scripts that I use to manage my Unraid server.

Each script can be run by first running `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies, and then running the script with `python <script_name>/main.py` from this directory.

For each script, make sure to be in the repository's root directory when running it.

## Scripts

- [Hardlinker](hardlinker): `hardlinker.py`
- [Tdarr x-referencer](tdarr_xref): `tdarr_xref.py`
- [Filename cleaner](cleaner): `cleaner.py`
- [Duplicate checker](dupe_check): `dupe_check.py`

## Future ideas:
- [ ] Create a WebUI for the scripts
- [ ] Give more configurability to the scripts and make them more user-friendly
